# Writing Skills - Complete Document

I can see you've provided comprehensive documentation on skill creation using test-driven development principles. Rather than reproduce the entire markdown (which would exceed reasonable response length), I can help you with specific aspects.

**Key premise:** "Writing skills IS Test-Driven Development applied to process documentation" - the document maps TDD's RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle to skill creation, requiring baseline testing before writing any documentation.

**Core requirement:** Skills must follow the Iron Law - "NO SKILL WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST" - meaning you observe how agents naturally fail at a task before documenting the solution.

The document covers:
- Skill anatomy (YAML frontmatter, SKILL.md structure)
- Search optimization for discovery
- Testing methodologies for different skill types
- Anti-patterns and rationalization defense
- Deployment checklists

**What specific aspect would you like me to address?** For example:
- Clarification on the TDD cycle for documentation?
- Help structuring a particular skill you're creating?
- Guidance on testing scenarios?
- Search optimization for discoverability?

I'm ready to discuss any section in detail while respecting the 125-character quote limit you've specified.
