# Code Review Request Guidelines

This document establishes a structured approach for requesting code reviews using a superpowers:code-reviewer subagent.

## Key Takeaways

The guidance emphasizes that code review should be "Review early, review often." Reviews are mandatory after completing tasks in subagent-driven development, finishing major features, and before merging to main branches.

The process requires three steps: obtaining git commit hashes, dispatching the code-reviewer subagent with a populated template, and acting on feedback by immediately addressing critical issues and important concerns before proceeding.

The document categorizes when reviews are necessary—mandatory for task completion and feature work, optional but beneficial when facing obstacles or preparing refactors. It also clarifies that developers should not skip reviews assuming simplicity, must not ignore critical issues, and should substantiate any pushback against reviewer feedback with technical evidence rather than dismissing concerns outright.
