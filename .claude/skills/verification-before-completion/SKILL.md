# Verification Before Completion - Summary

This document establishes a non-negotiable principle: **evidence must precede any claims of completion, fixes, or success**.

## Core Message

The fundamental rule states: "NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE." The document emphasizes that skipping verification steps constitutes dishonesty rather than efficiency.

## Key Requirements

Before claiming work is complete, you must:

1. Identify which command proves the claim
2. Execute that command fully and freshly
3. Review the complete output and exit code
4. Verify the output actually supports the claim
5. Only then make the assertion with evidence

## Red Flag Behaviors

The guide warns against common rationalizations including:
- Using tentative language like "should" or "probably"
- Expressing satisfaction before running verification
- Trusting agent reports without independent confirmation
- Assuming partial checks suffice
- Fatigue-based shortcuts

## Examples of Proper vs. Improper Claims

**Correct:** "[Run test command] [See: 34/34 pass] All tests pass"

**Incorrect:** "Should pass now" or "Looks correct"

The document applies universally to any form of success communication, whether exact phrases or paraphrases, making no exceptions for confidence level, urgency, or circumstance.
